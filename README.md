  This is a in-class academic project in class "Intermediate Software Developing". Please notice that all the data in this project is fake!

  It is a user-friendly application, provides restaurant searching, dish-searching and food-ordering services to customers. 

  After users open the application, he/she can input the restaurant name or dish name he/she wants to search into the search bar and start searching. Results will appear at the middle of the frame. Customers can also sort the result by restaurant rate, aaverage waiting time and restaurant average waiting time. After register/log in, he/she can sort the result by distance between restaurant and his location.

  After log in, users can start ordering. Press the restaurant picture and the menu of the restaurant will show up. Customers can add order into checkout list and can modify the list anytime. After finishing ordering he/she can choose to pay online (through our system) or to pay later in restaurant. If customer choose to pay now, the system will check the credit-card information (but will not connect to the bank since all the data is fake).
